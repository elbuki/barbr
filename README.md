This is a watchOS app that I use to book appointments to my local barber. It uses URLSession to call TidyCal to perform the following actions:
* List available booking times (1 week range from current time).
* Book an appointment.
* Cancel an appointment.

This should be just enough for covering the whole booking experience.
